\chapter*{Abstract}

The proliferation of internet of things and biomedical sensors has created a high demand for low-power signal processing interfaces. In many of these applications, the signals of interest are sparse, characterized by long periods of inactivity. Classical synchronous analog to digital converters are inherently inefficient in such scenarios, as they consume dynamic power continuously due to the global clock, regardless of the input signal activity.
Ideally the sampling rate should dynamically be adapted to the signal properties, so that power consumption due to the clock activity could be minimized. 
However, an adaptive sampling rate is not straightforward. As such, the use of an asynchronous ADC is a natural approach to sample non-uniform signals. Asynchronous ADCs require architectural changes, to allow proper operations without a global clock.
The adoption of asynchronous control in Flash architectures is primarily motivated by the need to eliminate power consumption high-speed clock distribution networks, thereby improving energy efficiency. Furthermore, asynchronous operation offers intrinsic benefits in handling comparator metastability and reducing latency, making it particularly attractive for high-speed, event-driven applications where signal activity varies significantly over time.
This dissertation proposes the design and implementation of an asynchronous Flash ADC. By removing the clock, the proposed architecture aligns power consumption with the input signal activity, theoretically achieving a much lower power consuption.

To address this, an offline trimming strategy is proposed to calibrate the comparator offsets without compromising the high-speed operation of the flash topology. The work encompasses the theoretical analysis, schematic design, and validation of the system through analog/mixed-signal co-simulation. The expected outcome is a robust, clockless ADC architecture that offers a superior figure of merit for sparse signal applications in compared to conventional synchronous architectures.
